# Streamlit Machine Learning Web Application

![Example](maxresdefault.jpg)

This is a repository that demonstrates how to create a simple machine learning web application using the Streamlit library in Python. The application includes a user interface with various input widgets such as sliders, select boxes, and radio buttons for the user to input the required data. The application also includes input validation functions that ensure that the user inputs the correct data types and values.

The main function of the application is to make predictions using a pre-trained machine learning model. The application loads the pre-trained model and prepares the input data for making predictions. Once the user inputs the required data and clicks the "Submit" button, the input data is passed to the pre-trained model to make a prediction. The prediction and probability are then displayed to the user in the Streamlit user interface.

This repository includes a Python script that demonstrates how to create a machine learning web application using Streamlit. The script can be used as a template for creating similar applications for other machine learning models. The repository also includes a requirements.txt file that lists the required Python libraries for running the application.

Overall, this repository provides a useful resource for anyone interested in creating machine learning web applications using the Streamlit library in Python.

# Steps to Run the Application

### 1- Clone the repository to your local machine.

### 2- Install the required Python libraries using the following command:


`pip install -r requirements.txt`


### 3-Run the following command to start the Streamlit server:


`streamlit run app.py`


## 4- Once the server is running, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to view the Streamlit user interface.

### 5- Input the required data in the input widgets.

### 6- Click the "Submit" button to make a prediction using the pre-trained machine learning model.

# Finally The prediction and probability will be displayed to the user in the Streamlit user interface.
